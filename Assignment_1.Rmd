## Document assignment

Consider the following situation:  
  
A sloppy printer produces books with an average of 2 misprints per page. You want to
know how many pages have more than k misprints in a book of n pages. Make an n x k table that shows the relationship between the total number of pages in a book and the number of pages with k misprints.

Show and explain your work.  Include equations and calculations to teach the reader how to solve the problem.  Include an image of a book.

Push your solution to a github repository and submit the url for repository on blackboard.
Be sure your repo includes your document as a pdf file and as an RMD file.  Include other files needed to recompile your document.

## Result

```{r echo=FALSE}
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)

nrow = 6
ncol = 6

k <- c(0,1,2,3,4,5)
n <- c(5,10,15,20,25,30)

error <- data.frame()

for (m in 1:nrow){
  error[m,1] <- n[m]
}


for (sel in 1:nrow){
  for (selc in 1:ncol){
    p_k <- 1 - ppois(k[selc], lambda = 2)
    pcond <- pbinom(n[sel], 50, p_k)
    error[sel,selc+1] <- pcond
  }
}

colnames(error) <- c("n", "0", "1", "2", "3", "4", "5")

kable(x = error, booktabs = T, caption = "Probability of pages with k misprints") %>%
  kable_styling(position = "center", latex_options = "hold_position") %>%
  add_header_above(c(" " = 1, "Least Misprints" = 6))
```

For this question, the result should be the conditional probability. This situation is to find out n pages have more than k misprints. We can assume there is a 50 pages book which needs to be printed.

First, we should calculate a cumulative probability for more than k misprints which follows poisson distribution.

The equation to get CDF of poisson distribution is: $e^{-\lambda }\sum_{i=0}^{k}\frac{\lambda ^{i}}{i!}$

Like if we want to know the probability of more than 2 misprints, the equation should look like: $e^{-2}\sum_{i=2}^{n}\frac{2^{i}}{i!}$

Then, we need to calculate the conditional probability of pages which have more than k misprints. This is a binomial distribution situation because we will get pages which have no more than k misprints and pages have more than k misprints.

Through these process, we can get the final table as above.
